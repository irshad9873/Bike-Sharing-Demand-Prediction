## Problem Description:
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

# Data Description:

• Date : year-month-day • Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour • Hour - Hour of the day • Temperature-Temperature in Celsius • Humidity - % • Wind speed - m/s • Visibility - 10m • Dew point temperature - Celsius • Solar radiation - MJ/m2 • Rainfall - mm • Snowfall - cm • Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn • Holiday - Holiday/No holiday • Functional Day - NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)

Introduction The present scenario is about how good is the customer service in any industry as the number of options at the customer’s disposal is unlimited. So, it becomes extremely important to make sure that the customers will not be made to wait for the rental bikes. It would also not be practical to keep lot of bikes even when the demand is low. Hence, with the help of machine learning, this project aims at predicting the rental bike demand so that no problems arise.

# Data Pipeline 

1.Exploratory Data Analysis: The first step of our project is performing the EDA process on the dataset so that we can get the idea about the dataset i.e. the number of variables, the data type of the variables , visualize the dataset for Better understanding and decide the suitable methods and algorithms that might produce desired outcomes

2.Data Preprocessing: In EDA process we find the type of dataset and decide the approach, in this project the preprocessing steps would removing the punctuations, stopwords , generate count vectorizer and document term matrix which would help in building up the model.

3.Building Machine Learning Model: After the data preprocessing is done then the data will be ready to be fit into machine learning models .For current problem statement topic modeling approach would be suitable . In topic modeling, a topic is defined by a cluster of words with each word in the cluster having a probability of occurrence for the given topic, and different topics have their respective clusters of words along with corresponding probabilities.

# Conclusions

The project comes to an end at this point. Beginning with loading the dataset, so far we have done EDA, pre-processing the data, Label encoding, Scaling the data, splitting the data into train and test data, applying various machine learning algorithms followed by hyper parameter tuning. We implemented 8 M.L. models. After comparing the mean square error and mean root square error of all the models, XGBoost has least mean square error and root mean square error. XGBoost has highest accuracy of 91.9% among all algorithms. So, We can conclude that XGBoost is the best model to predict rented bike count. The number of business hours of the day and the demand for rented bikes were most correlated and It makes sense also. Highest number of bike rented at the 18th hour of day. Total number of bike count increased when there was favourable temperature. So, this can be an important factor in predicting underlying patterns of rented bike count.
